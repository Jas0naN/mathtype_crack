## How to Prevent MathType's Forced Update Popups by Blocking Internet Access

This guide blocks MathType's internet access via the Windows Firewall, preventing it from contacting its update server and stopping forced update popups.

1.  **Open Windows Defender Firewall Settings:**
    *   Open the **Control Panel**.
    *   Go to **System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall**.
    *   In the left pane, click **Advanced settings**.

2.  **Create a New Outbound Rule:**
    *   In the left pane of the "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security" window, select **Outbound Rules**.
    *   In the right pane (Actions pane), click **New Rule...**.

3.  **Select Rule Type:**
    *   In the New Outbound Rule Wizard, select **Program** and click **Next**.

4.  **Specify the MathType Program:**
    *   Select **This program path:**.
    *   Click **Browse...** and navigate to the installation directory of MathType on your computer (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\MathType`).
    *   Select the **MathType.exe** file and click **Open**. Click **Next**.

5.  **Choose the Action:**
    *   Select **Block the connection**. Click **Next**.

6.  **Select When the Rule Applies:**
    *   Check all three network profile boxes: **Domain**, **Private**, and **Public**. Click **Next**.

7.  **Name the Rule:**
    *   Give the rule a clear name, for example: `Block MathType Internet Access` or `Prevent MathType Updates`.
    *   (Optional) Add a description like "Blocks MathType.exe to prevent forced update popups". Click **Finish**.

**Done.** The new rule is now active. MathType.exe will be blocked from accessing the internet, preventing connection to its update server and stopping forced update popups.

**If you use other firewall software:** If you are using a different firewall (e.g., from your antivirus suite or a third-party application), please consult its documentation on how to block a specific program from accessing the internet. Apply a rule to **block outbound connections for MathType.exe**.
